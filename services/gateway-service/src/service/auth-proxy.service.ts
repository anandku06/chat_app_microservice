/**
 * This file defines the AuthProxyService, which is responsible for communicating with the Auth Service to validate authentication tokens and retrieve user information. It uses Axios to make HTTP requests to the Auth Service and handles any errors that may occur during these requests. The service is designed to be used by other parts of the Gateway Service to ensure that incoming requests are authenticated before they are processed further.
