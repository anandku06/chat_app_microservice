/**
 * This file contains the repository functions for the User entity. It provides an abstraction layer over the database operations, allowing us to interact with the User model without directly coupling our business logic to the database implementation. The functions in this file include creating a new user, finding a user by their email, and finding a user by their ID. Each function interacts with the UserModel defined in the db/models/user.model.ts file and returns data in the format defined by the User type in types/user.ts.
